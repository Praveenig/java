1. we must use static and final
    static datatype identifier name= identifier

2. there are two types are in java 
	1 primitive datatype.
	2 non-primitive dataype.

3. if the data type of a variable is known at compile time. This means that you must specify the type of the declare the veriable.

4. Naming convention for java
	Uppercase
	Lowercase

5. specifying an initial value to assign to it.

6. combining all the similar type data in one unit.

7. no.

8. in the heap area.

9. Advantages of Array
	> Easily accessing elements using the index. 
	> Reduce the time comlexity.
	> it will helpfull for metrix.

10. 

11. class Array{

	public static void main(String a[]){
		String elements={"one","Two","Three","Four"};
		for(int a=0; a=elements.lenght;i++)
		System.out.println(+elements[i]);
	}
} 	
12. 
13.
14.

15. If we don't initialize the numbers in array, it can be anything. 
    Using this instead saves to having to loop over the array and assign every value to 0. 

16. 
17. static keyword = This is pericular member to belongs to the types of itself .
	static veriable =static veriable is also called as class variable and class initialization is initializing staic variable
	static method = static method is belongsto the class only,and rather than instance of class.
	
18. yes.
 
19. The JVM can ivoking it without instastiating the class.

20. This is set of instruction that run only one when class is loaded in into memory.

21. No.

22. No.

23. Calling one Constructor to another Constructor.

24. This is special method,is used to initialize objects.
	there are two type 
	1. default Constructor.
	2. Parameterized Constructor.
	
25. 

26. yes.

27. Using extend Keyword.

28. class is blueprint which we use objects ,
	instance is asingle or unique of the class.

29. six way.
  
30. instantiateing a class.
